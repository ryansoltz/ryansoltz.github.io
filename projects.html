                <p class="text">For the final project in my DASC 240 course I was tasked with creating a model that predicted something based on a dataset and writing a report with a group. Me and my group decided to take a dataset of NBA player statistics from the 2023/2024 season and make a model that predicted the PPG (points per game) of a player based on factors like their age, position, and a few others. </p>

                <p class="text">For my FILM 310 class I had to make a 1-minute film with a partner, in order to learn the basics of filmmaking. We decided to make a suspenseful mystery film set in a parking ramp at night about someone being followed by a serial killer. It gave me good experience with  how to operate a camera, set up a scene, and video/audio editing.</p>

I did my project on the environmental history/development of East Asia since the 1600s, and was able to identify patterns in environmental development across the region and reasons why the environments are the way they are today. </p>
