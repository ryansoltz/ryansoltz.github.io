                <p class="text">For the final project in my DASC 240 course I was tasked with creating a model that predicted something based on a dataset and writing a report with a group. Me and my group decided to take a dataset of NBA player statistics from the 2023/2024 season and make a model that predicted the PPG (points per game) of a player based on factors like their age, position, and a few others. </p>

We decided to make a suspenseful mystery film set in a parking ramp at night about someone being followed by a serial killer. It gave me good experience with the filmmaking process. Things like how to operate a camera, set up a scene, and video/audio editing.</p>
